#' @description  Caclulate average weight of all vehicles traveling the road for use in pavedRoadDustEmissions
#' @concept It is important to note that Equation 1 calls for the average weight of all vehicles traveling the road.
#' For example, if 99 percent of traffic on the road are 2 ton cars/trucks while the remaining 1 percent consists of
#' 20 ton trucks, then the mean weight "W" is 2.2 tons. More specifically, Equation 1 is not intended to be used to
#' calculate a separate emission factor for each vehicle weight class. Instead, only one emission factor should be
#' calculated to represent the "fleet" average weight of all vehicles traveling the road.
